- **System-wide Integration**: Set as default Android TTS engine to work with any app that supports system text-to-speech
- **Lightweight**: Minimal APK size (~200KB) with no bloat
- **Smart Caching**: Local caching of synthesized speech to reduce network usage and improve response time
- **Configurable Cache**: Customizable cache size limits with automatic pruning
- **Multi-language Support**: Chinese and English language support
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed - free to use, modify, and distribute

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Android device with Android 5.0+ (API 21+)
- Internet connection (for API calls)
- Enable "Unknown sources" for APK installation

### Installation
1. Download the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/KonkaTV514/android-milore-tts/releases)
2. Install the APK on your Android device
3. Go to **Settings > Accessibility > Text-to-speech output**
4. Select **Milora TTS** as your preferred engine
5. Adjust speech rate and other settings as needed

### Building from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KonkaTV514/android-milore-tts.git
cd android-milore-tts
# Open in Android Studio or build with gradle
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Cache Settings
The app allows you to configure cache behavior:
- **Cache Limit**: Set maximum number of cached audio files (recommended: 10-200)
- **Clear Cache**: Manually remove all cached files
- **Clear Data**: Reset all app preferences and cached data

### API Usage
This app uses the [Milora API](https://api.milorapart.top/) for speech synthesis. The API is called with:
- **Text**: The content to be synthesized
- **Format**: Audio format (mp3 or wav, defaults to mp3)

## 📖 How It Works

Milora TTS implements Android's `TextToSpeechService` to provide a system-level TTS engine:

1. **Text Processing**: Receives text from any Android app via system TTS framework
2. **Cache Check**: First checks local cache for previously synthesized speech
3. **API Call**: If not cached, sends request to Milora API for synthesis
4. **Audio Decoding**: Decodes MP3 response to PCM audio using MediaCodec
5. **Playback/Caching**: Plays audio through system and caches for future use

5. Open a Pull Request

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Internet Required**: This TTS engine requires an active internet connection to function
- **Third-party API**: Speech synthesis depends on the Milora API, which is a separate service
- **Privacy**: Text sent for synthesis is transmitted to Milora's servers
- **Service Reliability**: Functionality depends on Milora API availability
